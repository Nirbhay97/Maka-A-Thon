# Problem_statement
1. Our aim was to develop a low cost hardware solution to perform hand gesture tracking. 

# Introduction
1. To track the movement of motion of hand, our team had decided to use IMU (inertial measurement unit). 
2. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a device that can measure and report specific gravity and angular rate of an object to which it is attached. An IMU typically consists of:
3. Gyroscopes: providing a measure angular rate
4. Accelerometers: providing a measure specific force/acceleration
5. Magnetometers (optional): measurement of the magnetic field surrounding the system

# Sensor and Software Used:
1. IMU (Intertial Measurement Unit)
2. Blender 3D Modelling 
3. Arduino IDE
4. ESP 32 DEV
